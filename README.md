# ❓ What is `discord-bot-dashboard-python`

> A web service in Flask for managing you discord bot!

It's a project about making a feature rich discord bot that I discontinued in the end of 2021. It was used to allow users to enter custom welcome messages whenever a new user entered their server.

# 🎯 My first Flask web service project

In 2021, I was an active user on discord and I really enjoyed those discord bots, and decided to make may own. Obviously without experience I couldn't go too far with this project and the result was quite crappy, not for the looks, but for the user experience. The loading time was infinite.

So I decided to study more about web development and learn React. In the main repo of the old bot [here](https://github.com/paolo-05/xgn-bot/), you can find also the frontend and the backend of the webiste.

# 🚧 Running this web server

Although I don't raccomend you do it, here the step by step guide:

1. clone the repo ```git clone https://github.com/paolo-05/discord-bot-dashboard-python```
2. as you can see there is no `requirements.txt` file so you have to figure it out on your own :D
3. complete the fields in the `config.py` file (maybe store them in a more secure way than I did)
4. you are done :)
