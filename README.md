# NOTE
This is an old version of [this](https://xgnbot.xyz), so it isn't working and you can't use this for make your own dashboard, you can use the code only with educational purpose, having said that:

### RUN
To run this app you need in the config.py file and insert the strings required also you need a bot with an api it self i suggest going [here](https://github.com/ahnaf-zamil/discord.py-bot-dashboard/blob/master/bot/cogs/server.py) to understend more.
